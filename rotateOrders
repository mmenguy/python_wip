xyz - first is rotated last

if y is down the axis, x back:

yzx - rotate y affects nothing else
	rotate z takes y with it
	rotate x takes all with it. 

	y should be first to keep the rotate down the bone clean
	x should be the more dominant axis (takes the whole things with it)
	z is the axis that will cause gimble lock . . . 
	

	 Basically first axis is a much used axis, down the chain if necessary
	 Third is dominant axis of action
	 Second should be the LEAST used axis for sure (this is the one that will create gimble lock with the first)
