figure out where the dictionary lives

Then you have a dictionary of the registered python scripts you have. . . scriptName: commandToRun


create function to update . . . 
	
	should have a location list to seek out scripts (you can edit this)

	will grab your regScriptList and create an entry for each script
	script ----> command
	the command is editable
	if there is no command, it will highlight red

	you can add a command which will give a popup window(?) for the scriptName
	when you save it, it will overwrite the existing. . . 

	maybe a button to open the file itself (also something to choose what to open with?)

	You can also refresh based on scripts in the locations



	SHOULD be a registered script process when you want to add a new script to your system
